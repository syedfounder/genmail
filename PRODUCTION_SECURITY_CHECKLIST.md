# Production Security Checklist for GenMail

## ðŸš€ Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### âœ… **Critical Security Fixes (MUST DO)**

- [ ] **Remove Console Logs**: Run `npm run build:prod` instead of `npm run build`
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify all production env vars are set correctly
- [ ] **Domain Configuration**: Update hostname patterns in `next.config.mjs`
- [ ] **SSL/TLS**: Ensure HTTPS is enforced on your domain
- [ ] **Database Security**: Verify RLS policies are active in production

### âœ… **Environment Variables Checklist**

Ensure these are properly set in your deployment platform:

**Required:**
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Production Supabase URL
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Production anon key  
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Production service role key
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Production Clerk key
- [ ] `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Production Clerk secret
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`

**Security Requirements:**
- [ ] All keys are production-specific (not development/staging)
- [ ] Service role key has minimal required permissions
- [ ] No test/demo credentials in production environment

### âœ… **Next.js Configuration**

- [ ] `next.config.mjs` security headers are enabled âœ… (Fixed)
- [ ] CSP policy is restrictive for production âœ… (Fixed)
- [ ] ESLint validation enabled for prod builds âœ… (Fixed)
- [ ] TypeScript validation enabled for prod builds âœ… (Fixed)
- [ ] React strict mode enabled âœ… (Fixed)

### âœ… **Database Security Verification**

Run these queries in Supabase to verify security:

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false;
-- Should return no rows

-- Check rate limiting functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%rate_limit%';
-- Should show rate limiting functions

-- Verify cleanup functions exist  
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'cleanup_expired_inboxes';
-- Should return the cleanup function
```

### âœ… **Access Control Verification**

- [ ] Anonymous users can only create free inboxes
- [ ] Rate limiting is working (test with multiple requests)
- [ ] Authenticated users can only access their own data
- [ ] File upload restrictions are enforced
- [ ] Password-protected inboxes require authentication

### âœ… **Network Security**

- [ ] Supabase is in a GDPR-compliant region
- [ ] Clerk is configured for your region
- [ ] CDN/proxy caching headers are appropriate
- [ ] API routes are not cached inappropriately

### âœ… **Monitoring & Alerting Setup**

- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry/similar)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring enabled
- [ ] Database performance monitoring active
- [ ] Rate limit violation alerts configured
- [ ] Failed authentication attempt monitoring

### âœ… **Data Protection Compliance**

- [ ] Privacy policy is updated and accessible
- [ ] Terms of service are current
- [ ] Data retention policies implemented
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance measures active
- [ ] User data export functionality working
- [ ] Account deletion functionality working

### âœ… **Testing Before Launch**

**Security Testing:**
- [ ] Test rate limiting with multiple IPs
- [ ] Verify file upload restrictions
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify inbox isolation between users
- [ ] Test password protection functionality

**Performance Testing:**
- [ ] Load test inbox creation endpoint
- [ ] Test real-time email delivery
- [ ] Verify TTL cleanup is working
- [ ] Test concurrent user scenarios

### ðŸ”¥ **Known Security Strengths**

Your application already has these security measures in place:

âœ… **Strong Database Security**
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Parameterized queries via Supabase
- Automated data cleanup
- Comprehensive input validation

âœ… **Robust Authentication**
- Clerk integration with JWT validation
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, 10 rounds)
- Proper session management

âœ… **Multi-Layer Rate Limiting**
- IP-based rate limiting (5/hour for free users)
- User-based rate limiting for authenticated actions
- Database-level rate limiting functions

âœ… **File Security**
- Strict file type validation
- Size limits enforced (10MB)
- Dangerous file extensions blocked
- File hash deduplication

âœ… **Email Security**
- Spam filtering with content analysis
- SPF/DKIM validation
- Attachment scanning

## ðŸŽ¯ **Deployment Commands**

**For Production Build:**
```bash
# Run security checks and build
npm run build:prod

# Or manually:
npm run security-check
npm run remove-logs  
npm run build
```

**Environment-Specific:**
```bash
# Vercel
vercel --prod

# Manual deployment
npm run build:prod && npm start
```

## ðŸš¨ **Post-Deployment Verification**

After deployment, verify:

1. **HTTPS is enforced** - Check SSL Labs rating
2. **Security headers present** - Use securityheaders.com  
3. **Rate limiting works** - Test with multiple requests
4. **No console logs in production** - Check browser dev tools
5. **Error handling** - Verify no sensitive data in error responses

## ðŸ“ž **Security Contact**

For security issues in production:
- Create inbox creation rate limit violations
- Review Supabase audit logs regularly  
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Set up alerts for unusual activity patterns

**âœ… VERDICT: Your MVP is PRODUCTION READY** with the above fixes applied.

The security foundation is solid. The main concerns are operational (removing debug logs) rather than architectural vulnerabilities.
